<h1 class="mt-4 my-3">Immigration and Residency</h1>
<p>Cyprus has upgraded and relaxed the conditions and procedures of its immigration and naturalisation programmes, thereby allowing non-Europeans to obtain a permanent residence permit or instant naturalisation in Cyprus more easily and at a much faster pace.</p> 
<p>In addition to its favourable tax regime and status as an international financial and business centre, Cyprus offers a Mediterranean climate and an excellent quality of life. </p>
