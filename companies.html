      <h1 class="my-5">Cyprus Companies</h1>
      <p>Cyprus is one of the most popular locations in Europe for registering companies. In addition to having the lowest tax rate in the EU, Cyprus has Double Tax Treaties with 64 countries and many other tax advantages for enterprises. </p>
      <p>A combination of factors, such as the favourable tax legislation, the straightforward corporate legislation and the country’s stable tax policy has led to Cyprus becoming an attractive jurisdiction in which thousands of new companies are set up with the Registrar of Companies every year, making the country a significant international financial centre.</p>
      <p>Cyprus has an effective and developed legal system and, as a former British colony, it has a system of common law with business legislation similar to that of the UK. As Cyprus is a European Union member, a company registered in Cyprus enjoys all the advantages of operating in the EU.</p>
      <p>Overall it is a simple and straightforward process to incorporate a company in Cyprus and a corporate bank account can be opened without delay, and the Directors of the entity do not have to be present in Cyprus.</p>
